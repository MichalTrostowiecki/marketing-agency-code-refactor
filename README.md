# marketing-agency-code-refactor

## Description

Week 1 Bootcamp Challenge

I have created this small project to refactor the code of a marketing agency website. My goal was to make this website more accessible and optimize it for SEO. 

During this process, I learned the importance and role of semantic HTML, how to minimize size of CSS files by grouping selectors that share the same properties, and values also how adding descriptive alt attributes to images and icons can significantly impact experience of other users while visiting website.
